                                 <p class="p List1">(b) The Contractor agrees that if after award he or she discovers an organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract, he or she shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer which shall include a description of the action which the Contractor has taken or intends to take to eliminate or neutralize the conflict.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">The Government may, however, terminate the contract for the convenience of the Government if it would be in the best interest of the Government.
