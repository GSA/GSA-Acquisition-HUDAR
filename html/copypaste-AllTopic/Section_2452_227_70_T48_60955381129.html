This requirement applies to all Government information under the Contractor's accountability, stewardship, possession or control, including its subcontractors.

                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) If either the failure of the Government to provide information to the Contractor by the dates shown in this clause or the remedial action taken under this clause to correct defective information causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this contract, the Contracting Officer shall consider an equitable adjustment to the contract. The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer its written statement describing the general nature and amount of the equitable adjustment proposal within 30 days after the remedial action described in paragraph (ii) herein is completed, or within 30 days after the date upon which the Government failed to provide information, unless the Contracting Officer extends this period.

                                 <p class="p List2">(2) In the event of any loss, theft, damage, or destruction of Government information, the Contractor shall immediately take all reasonable actions necessary to protect the Government information from further loss, theft, damage, or destruction.
