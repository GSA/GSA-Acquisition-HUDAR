Appointing authorities shall also consider the size and complexity of contracts the individual will be required to execute or administer, and any other limitations on the scope of the authority to be exercised.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Individuals appointed to a position having Contracting Officer authority, and whose primary duties are performed as a Contracting Officer, other than contracting authority limited to simplified acquisition procedures, shall meet the following requirements:
